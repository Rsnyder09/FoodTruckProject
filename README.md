# FoodTruckProject

# Overview
This is a food truck app. Users will be prompted to enter a food truck name or quit initially. If the user selects quit without entering any food trucks the program will end. If the user enters a food truck name they will then be prompted to enter the type of food served and a rating from 1-5. If they enter all three the program will loop back to the first question. The max number of food trucks entered will be 5.

 Once the used has entered information, if they chose the QUIT option, a second menu will appear with four options. The user can select a number 1-4 depending on what they would like to do next. The four options are: 1.) List all existing food trucks. 2.) See the average rating of all food trucks. 3.) Display the highest rated food truck. 4.) Quit the program. 

If the user selects 1 the program will show information on all the trucks entered by the user as well as a unique ID.  If the user selects 2 the program will show the average rating for all trucks entered as well as all the trucks entered (name, food type, id, and rating). If the user selects 3 the highest rated food truck will be shown and its rating. If the user selects 4 the program will say goodbye and terminate. 


# Lessons Learned 
-	Parking lot App example helped me get started 
-	I need to go over Arrays, OOD, and probably  while/ for loops again and get a better grasp of them. 
-	I feel like I understood methods more and it cleaned up my app and made it more readable. 
-	Google is good for helping steer in a direction when I am stuck
-	I need to use Saturday TA time. This week I didn’t and it was because I was making good progress with my code. But once I was at a point where I was  stuck again  ( cant get my program to show second menu after I input 5 trucks, cant get my 3rd user input to be  1-5… I tried a for loop with an if statement but it would break my code or just break out of the code and terminate in console. So I just left it out) 
-	I really like switches, they make sense in my head.
-	Breaking my code a couple times caused me to panic, I was changing to much at one time then trying to run the app and wouldn’t know what helped or hurt. So I started only changing things one line at a time.
-	Command/option/S was helpful to write setters and getters. Also with toStrings.
-	Understanding the whole program before/during writing code is helpful for me. We did go over the homework in great detail on Friday, I felt like I understood it. But as I was starting to write code I would forget what step I was on so I was trying to go line by line with the directions. So i started to take breaks and re read the directions so I felt I understood the whole process.
